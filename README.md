# @hanut/arrays
Contains a suite of utilities to work with arrays in javascript such as 
searching and sorting algorithms.

This lets me work on solving the bigger issues without having to repeatedly
implementing these nifty functions over and over again.


## Features 
The functions in this library broadly cover two different aspects of dealing with
arrays -

1. Sorting - Implementations of the most common sorting algorithms in pure JS
2. Searching - Implementations of the most common search algorithms in pure JS
